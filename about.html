                        <p id="text_info">Third year computer science undergraduate at the University of Illinois Chicago. My experience here has shown me a wide variety
                            of the uses, theory, and mathematics of computers. The different and unique projects from class to class
                            has exposed me to a wide variety of computer topics. Through these classes, I have gotten a great insight
                            into how computers shape our lives as well as gaining a deeper appreciation for computer science as a whole.

                    <p id="text_info">Machine learning undergrad research intern. I worked under a professor and with PhD students in how machine learning can be used. I was able to look into and understand 
                        a topic being reseearched in - KSAT. Through this, I also had a small project that took in data and creating visual representation of that data using Python. This 
                        project acquainted me with the pre-processing stage of machine learning.
