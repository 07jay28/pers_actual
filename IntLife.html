                <h1 id="bookTitle">The Intellectual Life by A.G. Sertillanges</h1>
                <p id="revw">
                    This book was an recommended by Jared Henderson in one of his videos - if you read my review on Boethius's The Consolation of Philosophy then it is the same Youtuber; I seriously recommend watching him if you have even the slightest interest in philosophy. I've been meaning to read this book for a couple years now; it caught my attention in the title since I was beginning to ponder what being more intellectual in my reading could be like. What life could one lead if I were to commit to reading great works in order that I become "more human" and a better person. Before purchasing the book, I listened to a few more videos that discussed the book. I was hoping for some reason to not purchase the book; yet, I was always met with praise for the book and that, for what it can do, is set up the framework for leading an intellectual life. It did just that.

                    It was interesting to read this after finishing the Consolation of Philosophy and Praise of Folly - two books I also wanted to read and were my entry into taking philosophy seriously once again after graduating. The Intellectual Life is a book that you should deliberate with some consideration. Sertillanges is extending an invitation to a contemplative life and urges us to accept and meet the sublime. But he isn't writing to those who will sit in their spires all day if you will, rather, he also seems to write to those who have other things going in life - family, children, work, the general going-ons of the everyday. Even so, Sertillanges really is giving us an invitation and asks us to take seriously the proposition of leading an intellectual life. In accordance with intellectual virtues and the intellectual pleasures, this life offers the best and beautiful of humanity. The divine within shared out for us to enjoy. Sertillanges asserts that we must take about 2 hours of serious studying in engagement with a great material and, thus, live it out as a result in step with truth.

                    I particularly enjoyed reading this as I try to take my education into my hands once again. Something that I felt missing in my years at university were courses in the humanities; that was partly since I had gotten used to taking humanities during my high school years and, once I had no need or requirement to take one, was well aware of its absence. At the time, I did begin my reading habit and sunk my teeth into some rather difficult books that, were I to read them now, would still have much trouble with. I still laugh at the fact that I really did trudge through the Closing of the American Mind. After graduating and the future in the air, I look back once again at Lady Philosophy like Boethius. The Intellectual Life, when reading, is another reminder that we can lead an exciting intellectual life outside the classroom; in this day and age, it really is if we have the will and motivation to pursue it. The offer to join that life is on the table, I need only sign on the dotted line.
