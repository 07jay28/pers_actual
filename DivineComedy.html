                <p id="revw">
                    The Divine Comedy is one of my favorite books. Split into three stories – Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso – the Comedy is perhaps one of my favorite things to reread constantly. It is a dense book filled with many allusions to philosophy, classical myths, history, theology, science, mathematics, literature, politics, etc. and it is easy to miss all of it. This story is rich with metaphors and themes and is worth digesting slowly. It is a work to be appreciated and understood. This book led me to taking a class solely about Dante and the Divine Comedy and it was one of my favorite classes. If unable to read the book, Wendigoon does a wonderful three part video series going through each of the realms. It is entertaining to watch in order to get a general sense of the book, but I do recommend obtaining a well translated edition that comes with notes. As for the stories themselves, Dante does an incredible job at trying to explain a place that is beyond us. Whether you believe it accurately represents what you think Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven is, Dante masterfully structures these places. Take for example Cocytus, the final and lowest place of Hell. One would imagine the deepest level of Hell to be this infernal blaze yet, in a reversal of expectation, it is a cold, freezing lake. The damned are frozen in place with their tears turning to ice; all of which is caused by the beating of the Devil’s wings who is also frozen in the lake. This description alone does not give credit to the overall scene especially when he details the environment and his own feelings. Though Dante is aware of his hubris – his discussion with the great writers in Limbo as well as a heaviness of his pride in Purgatory – this book certainly backs up his abilities as a writer. Dante is a masterful writer and the depth you go down is worth going through if given the opportunity.

                    I’ve always enjoyed that the story begins through Hell. It relates to Christian humility, particularly that one must lower himself before ascending. Dante is denied an easy way out in the beginning and is required to go through the lowest levels before even reaching the base of Mount Purgatory. Not only that, it is a reminder that oftentimes we must endure Hell to see the better side of things. It relates to the Churchill quote “If you’re going through hell, keep going”. For me, I’ve always had a particular affinity to Canto XXVII of the Purgatorio – the scene where Virgil “crowns and mitres” Dante. It’s a touching scene especially since we have grown accustomed to Virgil accompanying Dante through the depths of Hell and the heights of Purgatory. Virgil, who constantly explains and teaches Dante, says his final words before his near disappearance. I love this canto. It reminds me a lot of the many teachers and mentors I’ve had who have imparted their wisdom and knowledge. I often look back at the things I’ve learned and from whom I learned them from with a sense of appreciation for the heights I’ve been able to climb to. We all have a Virgil in some way and feel like Dante at times. I grew to really enjoy these lines lately “My course is set for an uncharted sea / Minerva fills my sails, Apollo steers” after graduating. It is said in Paradiso (Canto II) as he begins his ascension into the heavenly bodies and after Virgil’s leave at the end of Purgatorio.

                    The Divine Comedy is a masterful work. My review cannot fully encapsulate the grandeur of the work nor the depths of its content. If given the opportunity, take a class on it and you will learn much. I would gladly take another class despite already doing so. I’ve read the Inferno four times, Purgatorio three times, and Paradiso two times. I never tire from rereading Inferno and Purgatorio; Paradiso, on the other hand, has much higher language and gets rather difficult but it is still worth the read. Dante urges us to look to the stars, I know I shall do so.
