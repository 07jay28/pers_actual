            <p id="me">Recent graduate from the University of Illinois Chicago with previous experiences as a software engineering intern and research intern. 
                <br><br>
                I am a Chicago native and grew up in Bridgeport. I attended Saint Ignatius College Prep and am currently studying computer science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). See below this section for my experience related to computers.
                <br><br>
                Outside of class, I am an avid reader enjoying a wide variety of literary genres - philosophy, business, history, science, classics. See my books page to see what I am reading or my Goodreads! I also enjoy cooking, playing chess (over the board or online), and video games.
                <br><br>

                        <p id="text_info">Graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Throughout my time there, I had an interest in low-level programming and took a particular interest towards concurrency, high performance computing, and systems programming. 
                            Some of my favorite projects I worked on in my classes were creating my own programming language in my compilers class, generating Mandelbrot images with OpenMP and MPI for my high-peformance computing class, and simulating Blockchain transactions in my concurrency class.
                            My studies there has shown me a wide variety of the uses, theory, and mathematics of computers. 
                            I have gotten a greater insight and appreciation for the intregral part computers play into our daily lives as well as the intricacies that goes into a computer.

                            the work done on KSAT. Through this, I also had a small project that took in data and created visual representations of that data in Python. This 
                            project acquainted me with the pre-processing stage of machine learning.
