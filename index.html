                I am a Chicago native and grew up in Bridgeport. I attended Saint Ignatius College Prep and am currently studying computer science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). See below this section for my experience related to computers.
                <br><br>
                Outside of class, I am an avid reader enjoying a wide variety of literary genres - philosophy, business, history, science, classics. See my books page to see what I am reading or my Goodreads! I also enjoy cooking, playing chess (over the board or online), and video games.
