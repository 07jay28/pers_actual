                Recent graduate from the University of Illinois Chicago with previous experiences as a software engineering intern and research intern. 
                <br><br>
                I am a Chicago native and grew up in Bridgeport. I attended Saint Ignatius College Prep and recently finished my studies in computer science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). See below for more about my experiences working with, studying, and using computers.
                <br><br>
                Outside of class, I am an avid reader enjoying a wide variety of literary genres - philosophy, business, history, science, classics. 
                Take a look at my 'Books' page to see some of my favorite books and my reviews on some of them! I also enjoy cooking, playing chess (over the board or online), and video games.
                <br><br>
                Since graduating, I have been studying more computer science subjects by reading the <i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</i> and <i>Hands on Machine Learning</i> to get a better idea of this growing area in computer science.
                I also have worked on understanding the data science area that I didn't get the chance to study. I have been using Databricks and Kaggle to do some projects understanding how to utilize data and create visual representations.
                Moreover, doing something outside of the computer science world, I have been learning Italian for a trip. I picked up language learning (as if programming languages weren't enough) out of a curiousity for other cultures and from an experience of previous attempts to learn Chinese and Japanese.
                I am also a big fan of Dante Alighieri and the Divine Comedy.

                            Graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Throughout my time there, I had an interest in low-level programming and took a particular interest towards concurrency, high performance computing, and systems programming. 
                            Some of my favorite projects I worked on in my classes were creating my own programming language in my compilers class, generating Mandelbrot images with OpenMP and MPI for my high-peformance computing class, and simulating Blockchain transactions in my concurrency class.
                            My studies there has shown me a wide variety of the uses, theory, and mathematics of computers. 
                            I have gotten a greater insight and appreciation for the intregral part computers play into our daily lives as well as the intricacies that goes into a computer.

                            the work done on KSAT. Through this, I also had a small project that took in data and created visual representations of that data in Python. This 
                            project acquainted me with the pre-processing stage of machine learning.
