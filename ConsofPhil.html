                <h1 id="bookTitle">Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius</h1>
                <p id="revw"> The story is set around Boethius’s imprisonment before his eventual execution. Boethius himself is one of the main figures of the book where he conversates with Lady Philosophy. Obviously being in prison isn’t a fun experience, he despairs at how low his fortune has become and laments the position he now finds himself in. Lady Philosophy reprimands him for becoming used to what Fortune has granted him and reminds him that Fortune constantly changes. The rest of the book is a philosophical conversation between Lady Philosophy and Boethius where she reteaches Boethius about the philosophical life he once knew but forgotten. The topics of the book are heavy in its philosophical content which ends with the theological question of the nature of God, good and evil, and trying to rationalize Him.
                    <br><br>It’s always interesting reading philosophy books after a while. 2025 hasn’t been a year of consistent reading for me and so returning to a philosophy book feels like a test on how much I remember from previous philosophy-related classes and books. Fortunately, I have read some Stoic literature and the Nicomachean Ethics, and fairly remember virtue ethics from junior year high school (thanks Fr. Gibson). Those certainly carried my understanding as the story’s conversation continued, thus, I didn’t feel too confused as the dialogue progressed yet there were times where I had to chew slowly. Even if you don’t have that background, I think reading it is still approachable. This book was a suggestion from the YouTuber Jared Henderson in his video “These books get me through hard times”. I recommend watching the video, Jared is the only online personality whom I get my book recommendations from and his content aligns with my interests. In choosing to read the book, I was hoping to find some consolation as well and I did get some. Finding a job, particularly in a terrible job market for new grads looking to be software engineers, can get you bogged down. Even more so when I feel like I should have been given a full time offer after dedicating two summers to intern at a company where throughout it all I received only positive feedback. It certainly feels as if Fortune has turned away from me just like she did with Boethius (without the imprisonment and execution of course). One feels urged to shake his fist at the universe and curse the heavens. Despite that being so, this book reminds me of the central goal that made me begin reading more philosophy, and by extent reading as a whole; namely, that the goal is to live a good life. It is a consolation to be reminded of that especially when swept up in Fortune’s tribulations and constant LinkedIn job postings (arguably it can become its own punishment in Dante’s Inferno). Marcus Aurelius writes “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” This certainly applies to the book and for myself. We are constantly disturbed by the world around us that at times it can feel quite anxiety driven and frustrating. It is worth cultivating an inner garden for which one can retreat to for solace and remind ourselves of what is important. I really enjoyed this book especially after a good amount of time away from philosophy. It is a worthwhile read if you find yourself in hard times and want/wish to look at philosophy for something. Lady Philosophy calls us to do good, it is a necessity we answer in return.
                    <br><br>    
                    “Avoid vice, therefore, and cultivate virtue; lift up your mind to the right kind of hope, and put forth humble prayers on high. <br> A great necessity is laid upon you, if you will be honest with yourself, a great necessity to be good, since you live in the sight of a judge who sees all things.”
