                <p id="revw">	The story is set around Boethius’s imprisonment before his eventual execution. Boethius himself is one of the main figures of the book where he conversates with Lady Philosophy. Obviously being in prison isn’t a fun experience, he despairs at how low his fortune has become and laments the position he now finds himself in. Lady Philosophy reprimands him for becoming used to what Fortune has granted him and reminds him that Fortune constantly changes. The rest of the book is a philosophical conversation between Lady Philosophy and Boethius which serves to remind Boethius of the philosophical life he once knew but forgotten. The topics of the book are heavy in its philosophical content which ends with the theological question of the nature of God and trying to rationalize Him.
                    <br><br>It’s always interesting reading philosophy books after a while. 2025 hasn’t been a year of consistent reading for me and so returning to a philosophy book feels like I am testing how much I remember from previous classes and books. Fortunately, I have read some Stoic literature and Nicomachean Ethics, and fairly remember virtue ethics from junior year high school (thanks Fr. Gibson). Those certainly carried my understanding as the story’s conversation continued, thus, I didn’t feel too lost in what was being said yet I did have to chew slowly. This book was a suggestion from the YouTuber Jared Henderson in his video “These books get me through hard times” – I recommend watching the video, Jared is the only online personality whom I get my book recommendations from. In a sense, I was hoping to find some consolation as well and I did get some. Finding a job, particularly in a terrible job market for new grad software engineers, can get you bogged down. Even more so when I feel like I deserved a full time offer after dedicating two summers to intern at a company and only receive positive feedback. It certainly feels as if Fortune has turned away from me much like she did with Boethius just without the imprisonment and execution. Yet, that being so, this book reminds me of the central goal that made me begin reading more philosophy, and by extent reading as a whole; namely, that the goal is to live a good life. It is a consolation to be reminded of that especially when swept up in Fortune’s tribulations and constant LinkedIn job postings. I have no say in the external, but full authority in the internal – a lesson apparent in Stoicism and in this book. I really enjoyed this book especially after a good amount of time away from philosophy. It is a worthwhile read if you find yourself in hard times and want/wish to look at philosophy. Lady Philosophy calls us to do good, it is a necessity we answer in return.

                    <center>“Avoid vice, therefore, and cultivate virtue; lift up your mind to the right kind of hope, and put forth humble prayers on high. A great necessity is laid upon you, if you will be honest with yourself, a great necessity to be good, since you live in the sight of a judge who sees all things.”
